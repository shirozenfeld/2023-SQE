# Software Quality Engineering - System Testing
This is a repository for the system-testing assignment of the Software Quality Engineering course at the [Ben-Gurion University](https://in.bgu.ac.il/), Israel.

## Assignment Description
In this assignment, we tested an open-source software called [Moodle](https://github.com/BGU-SE-Courses/2023-mbt-52-06).

Moodle is a free and open-source learning management system, used for blended learning, distance education, flipped classroom and other online learning projects in schools, universities, workplaces and other sectors.

## What we tested
We tested the Forum module, which enables both students and the teacher to have discussions and post comments, but is managed by the tacher only. We chose to test the following user stories: 
*User story 1:* The student comments on a forum

*Preconditions:* There is a course which is managed by a teacher, and there is a student which is signed up to the course. The course contains a forum.

*Expected outcome:* The comment is posted to the forum and is visible to everyone.

*User story 2:* The teacher deletes the forum.

*Preconditions:* There is a course which is managed by the teacher, and contains a forum.

*Expected outcome:* The forum is deleted successfully.

## How we tested
We used two different testing methods:
1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), a behavior-driven testing framework.
2. [Provengo](https://provengo.tech/), a story-based testing framework.

Each of the testing methods is elaborated in its own directory.
